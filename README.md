# EEG-Fringe-P3-analysis
This repository contains code for my MSc dissertation project, which investigates how different types and strengths of salience affect the P300 response - a reliable neural signature for the detection of salient stimuli - measured via EEG (using the Fringe-P3 method), during the Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) of different face stimuli.
