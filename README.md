# EEG-Fringe-P3-analysis
This repository contains code for my MSc dissertation project, which investigates how different types and strengths of salience affect the P300 response - a reliable neural signature for the detection of salient stimuli - measured via EEG (using the Fringe-P3 method), during the Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) of different face stimuli.

Please see my research proposal (located in the Proposal/ folder of this repository) for a full description of the research aims and methods.

## Disclaimer
This project is an ongoing work-in-progress. The files and folders in this repository may be incomplete, contain errors and/or not up to date.

## Contents
- README.md: (this file)
- Proposal/: a folder containing the research proposal report for the project (in .docx and .md format). This report outlines the background, aims, methodology and planned analysis of the study.
- Code/: a folder containing the required code for this project.

## Code/
The code/ folder contains the following:

- Preprocessing/: a folder containing all scripts used in the data preproccessing of this project.
- Analysis/: a folder containing all scripts used in the data analysis of this project.

In the Preprocessing/ folder, the following scripts are available:

- preprocessing.m: a script that performs all of the preprocessing, segmentation and artifact rejection on the raw EEG data (work in progress).

The Analysis/ folder is not yet populated, as the scripts are currently being written.
